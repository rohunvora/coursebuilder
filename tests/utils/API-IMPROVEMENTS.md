# Course Builder API v1.2 - Enhanced Test Server

## Summary of Fixes and Enhancements

This enhanced version (`test-api-server-v2.js`) addresses all the issues identified in the original test API server and adds several new features to provide a complete testing experience.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Route Parameter Bug** ✅
- **Problem**: POST handlers were defined with `(req, res, body)` but called with `(req, res, params, body)`
- **Fix**: Updated all handlers to accept `(req, res, params, body)` signature
- **Impact**: Server no longer crashes on POST requests

### 2. **Server-Side Answer Validation** ✅
- **Problem**: Server trusted client-supplied `correct` boolean
- **Fix**: Server now validates answers against stored `correctIndex`
- **Security**: Prevents clients from awarding themselves unearned XP

### 3. **Full 7-Skill Courses** ✅
- **Problem**: Courses only returned 2-3 skills instead of promised 7
- **Fix**: All courses now generate exactly 7 micro-skills
- **Enhancement**: Proper Bloom's taxonomy progression from Remember to Create

### 4. **Missing Endpoints** ✅
- **Problem**: No endpoints for achievements, streaks, or review scheduling
- **Fix**: Added 4 new endpoints:
  - `GET /api/achievements` - List all available achievements
  - `GET /api/achievements/:userId` - Get user's earned achievements
  - `POST /api/streak/:userId` - Update user's learning streak
  - `GET /api/review/:userId` - Get skills due for spaced review

### 5. **Data Persistence** ✅
- **Problem**: All data lost on server restart
- **Fix**: Automatically saves to `test-api-db.json` file
- **Benefit**: Testing sessions persist across restarts

### 6. **Standardized Analytics** ✅
- **Problem**: Confusing skill identifiers like "1753039902326-skill-1"
- **Fix**: Clean output with separate courseId and skillId fields
- **Enhancement**: Added review scheduling and achievement data

## New Features

### Achievement System
- 5 achievements with XP rewards:
  - First Steps (50 XP) - Submit first answer
  - Consistent Learner (100 XP) - 3-day streak
  - Week Warrior (250 XP) - 7-day streak  
  - Skill Master (200 XP) - Master a skill (>80% knowledge)
  - Rising Star (500 XP) - Reach level 5

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2)
- Implements the proven SM-2 algorithm
- Calculates optimal review intervals
- Tracks repetitions and ease factors
- Returns next review date with each answer

### Enhanced Course Generation
- Stoic Philosophy: Full 7-skill curriculum with real questions
- Generic topics: Structured progression through Bloom's taxonomy
- Difficulty scaling from 1-7
- Critic scores increase with complexity

### Improved Error Handling
- Validates all required parameters
- Returns helpful error messages
- Handles malformed JSON gracefully
- 404s for missing resources

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints (Enhanced)
```bash
# Health check - Lists all features
GET /api/health

# User management - With achievements and streaks
POST /api/user
GET /api/user/:userId

# Course generation - Now returns 7 skills
POST /api/course/generate
GET /api/course/:courseId

# Answer submission - Server validates correctness
POST /api/answer

# Analytics - Includes review schedule
GET /api/analytics/:userId
```

### New Endpoints
```bash
# Achievement system
GET /api/achievements          # List all achievements
GET /api/achievements/:userId  # User's achievements

# Streak management
POST /api/streak/:userId       # Update streak

# Spaced repetition
GET /api/review/:userId        # Skills due for review
```

## Testing

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the enhanced server
node test-api-server-v2.js

# Run comprehensive tests
./test-scripts-v2.sh
```

### Manual Testing Examples
```bash
# Create user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user

# Generate full course
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/course/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"Machine Learning"}'

# Submit answer (server validates)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId":"user-123",
    "courseId":"course-456", 
    "skillId":"skill-1",
    "answer":2,
    "confidence":4
  }'
```

## Migration Guide

To switch from the original to enhanced server:

1. Stop the original server
2. Start enhanced server: `node test-api-server-v2.js`
3. Existing test scripts work unchanged
4. New features available immediately
5. Data persists in `test-api-db.json`
