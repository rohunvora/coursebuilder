"""Learner model.

This module implements a rudimentary learner model using Bayesian
updating.  The learner model maintains a probability that the user
knows each microâ€‘skill and updates it based on observed answers.

In real systems you would likely implement one of the many knowledge
tracing models (e.g. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, Deep Knowledge
Tracing) to capture forgetting and learning curves.  The version here
is simplified for clarity and ease of extension.
