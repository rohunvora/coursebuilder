"""Exercise generation.

This module contains a toy exercise generator.  It accepts a
micro‑skill and returns a list of exercises.  Each exercise is a
dictionary with a ``question`` and ``answer`` field.  In real
production code you would integrate an LLM or template library to
produce varied and engaging content such as flash cards, cloze tests,
drag‑and‑drop questions, or simulations.
